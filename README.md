# Technical Portfolio: Autonomous Agent Systems

A showcase of real-world applications leveraging multi-agent LLM orchestration and high-performance data pipelines to solve complex challenges in finance, governance, and multimedia.
### Polymarket Autonomous Trading Framework [![Frontend Demo WIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)](https://vimeo.com/1165880877?fl=tl&fe=ec)

    Objective: To provide a competitive edge in decentralized prediction markets by transforming raw market data into actionable institutional-grade signals. This platform aims to automate the end-to-end lifecycle of a trade—from detecting market inefficiencies to risk-adjusted execution—minimizing human latency in high-stakes environments.

    Topics: Go | Python | PostgreSQL | ETL Pipeline | Data Engineering | AI/ML | Prediction Market Analysis | Blockchain.

### CivisNexus (Voter Intelligence Engine)

    Objective: To bridge the transparency gap between citizens and government by making legislative impacts and political histories accessible and digestible. The platform's goal is to empower voters with data-driven accountability, translating complex policy changes into clear societal outcomes through structured data taxonomy.

    Topics: Multi-Agent Systems | Data Taxonomy | Civic Tech | Knowledge Graphs | Blockchain | Analytics.

### AetherID (Sovereign Privacy Layer)

    Objective: To redefine online trust by enabling users to prove their identity and credentials without sacrificing data privacy. The primary objective is to build a secure, decentralized authentication framework that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to protect sensitive user information in the modern digital landscape.

    Topics: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) | Cryptography | Decentralized Identity (DID) | Privacy Engineering | Blockchain | Security.

### VisiCore: Intelligent Video Asset Manager [![Frontend POC WIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)](https://vimeo.com/1165928715?share=copy&fl=sv&fe=ci)

    Objective: To automate the categorization and discoverability of massive video libraries through advanced AI analysis. This project focuses on utilizing object detection and environmental recognition models to generate precise, automated tagging, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for multimedia asset management and searchability.

    Technical Implementation:

        Neural Architecture: Implements state-of-the-art vision models, including Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise mask generation and YOLO-based architectures for high-speed object detection and real-time classification.

        Optimization Layer: Features a performance-tuned processing pipeline that balances high-fidelity segmentation with low-latency inference, ensuring cost-effective scaling for large-scale video datasets.

        Metadata Extraction: Automatically derives granular attributes (environment, subject style, temporal events) and serializes them into a structured database for instant query retrieval.

    Topics: Computer Vision | Object Detection | Segment Anything (SAM) | YOLOv10/11 | Video Analytics | Automated Tagging | Metadata Extraction | Python | PyTorch.
