# Projects
### Polymarket Autonomous Trading Framework
This project is a high-performance, end-to-end autonomous trading system designed for prediction markets, evolving from initial research into Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) and financial algorithms into a custom, production-ready architecture. The system features a robust ETL and data normalization pipeline written in Go to leverage concurrency for real-time market data ingestion. A secondary feature engineering and signal generation pipeline in Python processes these normalized data streams, utilizing high-dimensional factors to identify market inefficiencies and predictive trends. The final layer is a modular Executor Agent in Go, designed to synthesize n signal inputs and market conditions to make high-confidence, autonomous execution decisions with sub-second latency. Built with a focus on low-latency performance and minimal technical debt, this project represents a scalable approach to merging agentic AI workflows with real-time financial execution.
Technical Stack

    Infrastructure & Execution: Go (Golang), PostgreSQL.

    Data Science & Analytics: Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch.

    Key Patterns: Multi-Agent Systems, High-Throughput ETL, Real-time Signal Processing.
